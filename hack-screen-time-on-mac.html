I forgot my Screen Time passcode in my iPhone 6S. How can I recover it?'</p><p>Since Apple released the Screen Time feature on iOS 12, this feature is largely used by most users. You can restrict the use of the app by setting a password, it's very necessary especially for children.

It lets you easily monitor habits, impose time limits, set restrictions to various apps and services, and more. But to secure any modifications to Screen Time, you must create a Screen Time passcode. It's especially important to do that when handing over your device to others.</p><p>However, you have the option to create system rescue DVDs (four blank DVDs are required), which can be used to return the hard disk to the factory default state, if needed. <a href='/acer-aspire-5750-bluetooth-driver.html' title='Acer aspire 5750 bluetooth driver'>Acer aspire 5750 bluetooth driver</a>.

But again, it didn't work starting iOS 13 and iPadOS 13.</p><p>Thankfully, Apple came to their senses. You can now change or remove your forgotten Screen Time passcode quite easily.
