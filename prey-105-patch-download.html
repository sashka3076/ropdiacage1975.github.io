The 1.04 patch brought PS4 Pro features but did not fix the framerate on the PS4 console. This time around, the new patch promises to do just that and much more.</p><img src='https://plusshort.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/5/2/125290973/865488180.jpg' alt='Prey 1.05 patch download torrent' title='Prey 1.05 patch download torrent'><p>The patch focuses on fixing the stuttering, but also brings a weapon malfunction message when the weapon gets jammed, and a bunch of fixes and improvements.
