We recommend Power Defragmenter for best defragging results, and our own comman line tool iso2usbld to convert or split games into USB Advance/Extreme format ..<br>http://my.opera.com/rejzor/blog/power-defragmenter-3-0-released<br>Other utilities are: USBUtil 2.0, USB Extreme installer or USB Insane.<br>---<br>SMB<br>---<br>For loading games by SMB protocol you need to share a folder (ex: PS2SMB)<br>on the host machine or NAS device and make sure that it has full read and write permissions. USB Advance/Extreme format is optional - *.ISO images are supported using the folder structure above with the added bonus that DVD9 images don't have to be split if your SMB device uses the NTFS or EXT3/4 file system.<br>----<br>HDD<br>----<br>For PS2, 48-bit LBA internal HDDs up to 2TB are supported. They have to be formatted with either WINHIIP or uLaunch. From there, use uLaunch to make a partition (rec. minumum of 2GB) named 'OPL'. If OPL detects this partition at start up, it'll automatically create the above directory structure. Use it to migrate ART, THEMES, CFGs, VMCs, etc. off your MC or USB stick to the internal HDD and free up space on those devices.<br>To launch OPL, you can use any of the existing methods for loading an executable elf.<br>On PS3, you need an original SwapMagic 3.6+ or 3.8 disc (at the moment there aren't any other options). The steps for loading OPL on a PS3 are:<br>1. Rename OPNPS2LD.ELF to SMBOOT0.ELF<br>2. Make a folder in root of USB device called SWAPMAGIC and copy<br> SMBOOT0.ELF to it.<br>3. Launch SwapMagic in PS3 and press UP+L1 then Open PS2 Loader should start.<br>There are 4 forms for launching elfs in SwapMagic.<br>SMBOOT0.ELF = UP + L1<br>SMBOOT1.ELF = UP + L2<br>SMBOOT2.ELF = UP + R1<br>SMBOOT3.ELF = UP + R2<br></li><li><br></li><li><br>- OPL Development Team -<br>(as of right now listed in current stable version 0.9.3)<br>CODERS:<br>BatRastard<br>crazyc<br>dlanor<br>doctorxyz<br>hominem.te.esse<br>ifcaro<br>izdubar<br>Jay-Jay<br>jimmikaelkael<br>misfire<br>Polo35<br>reprep<br>SP193<br>volca<br>Berion<br>.. and the anonymous ..<br>QUALITY ASSURANCE:<br>Berion<br>danielB<br>ElPatas<br>E P<br>gledson999<br>lee4<br>LocalH<br>RandQalan<br>ShaolinAssassin<br>yoshi314<br>zero35<br>NETWORK UPDATE:<br>icyson55<br></li></ul><img src='https://eroclever.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/4/8/124890735/833487242.png' alt='Download Winhiip Ps2 Hd Loader' title='Download Winhiip Ps2 Hd Loader'><br><h3 id='download-winhiip-ps2-hd-loader-mod'>Download Winhiip Ps2 Hd Loader Mod</h3><table border='0' width='100%' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tbody><tr><td valign='top'><p align='center'><strong><font size='5'>HDLoader<br> -----------------<br></font><font size='4'>How to install HDLoader into PS2 ?</font></strong></p><p>Before you can use <strong>HDLoader</strong>, you will need the following:<br></p><ol><li><div> An official Sony PS2 network adapter, as shown below. <br> Either type (Ethernet only, Ethernet and Modem) can be used.<br></div></li><li>A suitable hard disk drive.
