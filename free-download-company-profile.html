A powerful <strong>company profile template presentation</strong> should be more than just a brochure. It vibrantly showcases your business and engages with stakeholders about your company’s offerings and unique qualities.</p><p>Most small businesses don't spend time building a company profile template. until they need it. While these profiles are sometimes designed as one-pager documents or even infographics, we continue to defend that the slide presentation format is probably the best.</p><p>The challenge with one-pagers and infographics is that once built, adding or removing information is complicated. With a presentation, on the other hand, you can add, or hide slides to be able to tailor the company to whoever is receiving it.</p><p><em>Related article: </em><em>what is a company profile template?</em></p><h3><strong>Uses for a Company Profile Template</strong></h3><p>When we initially designed these slides, we called them 'Public Company Intro Template,' since they were meant to be a sort of public investor deck that the companies could embed on their websites (we still think that's a good idea, BTW). <a href='https://nifhh.over-blog.com/2020/10/sonic-mania-plus-mac-download.html' title='Sonic mania plus mac download'>Sonic mania plus mac download</a>.</p><p>Depending on the kind of website your company has, a company intro in presentation form might be a good way to get people engaged in what to do. </p><p>All Slidebean presentations are embeddable, all you need is a code snippet, and the frame will automatically adapt to the width of your site and the device where it's been loaded. </p><p>Still, we've revamped the deck to be more fitting for a short company profile that could be shared as a standalone presentation, or included as an introduction to a sales pitch or a consulting proposal. </p><p>These standalone presentations can be shared as an intro to a potential client, included in your website contact form or your email autoresponder. They can also be appended to your email signature or used for social media marketing. .</p><p>Finally, if you set your privacy settings to Public, the slides may be indexed by Google and other search engines, providing yet another result for your Search Engine Optimization efforts (back in 2016, we invested about $70,000 in SEO and so far, have made over $500,000 in revenue just from those campaigns). </p><h4>Why You Need a Company Profile</h4><ul><li>It creates an opportunity for collaborations.

If you don't have one, try using our Flickr and Unsplash integrations to find one that relates to your business. </p><h4><strong>2- Basic Numbers</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>We used founding year, customers served and monthly active users as examples, but the idea here is to find some metrics, accomplishments or awards that you can brag about. </p><h4><strong>3- Mission and Vision</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>We've exchanged the traditional mission/vision statements for our concept of company culture (vision-less), but understand all the reasons why these have to be there. </p><h4><strong>4- Team</strong></h4><h3 id='free-download-company-profile-powerpoint-templates'>Free Download Company Profile Powerpoint Templates</h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Talk about your core team, or at least, the part that is relevant to whomever you are sharing this document with. Try to keep it to 2-4 people, and add the shortest possible summary about them. </p><h3 id='free-download-company-profile-template-word-format'>Free Download Company Profile Template Word Format</h3><h4><strong>5- Services</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>This is a kind of 'what we do' slide which again, might not apply to every single context. If you are using this presentation for a business proposal, you may want to mention other services or products your company has, as a way to bring some context into the pitch. </p><h4><strong>6- Clients</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>There is no better proof than social proof. This slide is your chance to brag about your most nameworthy customers and some of the projects you've developed with them. </p><h4><strong>7- Projects</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>As an extension of the Clients slide, bring in some highlight projects/products that you've developed. Get a star, hero image for each one of them and add a small brief of what your company did. </p><h4><strong>8- Quotes </strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>Again, social proof is really valuable for these presentations. If you have quotes from press or reviews from relevant people, this is where they belong. </p><h4><strong>9- Contact information</strong></h4><div class='jpgqji'><iframe width='auto' height='auto' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Gk8yIuWZZY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p><strong>‍</strong>Website, email and social.
