The most popular versions among OBD II Scan Tool users are 1.6 and 1.0. This free software is an intellectual property of Alex C. The size of the latest downloadable setup file is 673 KB. The program's installer files are commonly found as OBD2.EXE or FACTORY.exe etc.</p><p>Nissan/INFINITI updated their position statement on pre- and post-repair scanning. The revised position statement touches on more subjects and gives additional information on the subject.</p><p>The Nissan Revised Pre- and Post-Repair Scanning, Calibrations position statement and the Revised Pre- and Post-Repair Scanning, Calibration position statement explain that a pre-repair system scan is recommended on all vehicles: “The presence of increasingly sophisticated and inter-connected technology supports and necessitates the requirement of all Nissan vehicles, having a diagnostic system scan to identify any diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) present, even in cases where there is no identifiable malfunction indicator light (MIL) illuminated on the vehicle’s dashboard.”</p><span><em><span>Figure 2 - INFINITI Pre- And Post-Repair Scanning Position Statement.</span></em></span><p>However, Nissan/INFINITI has added that all vehicles 2008 and newer are required to have a post-repair scan. Also, 1996-2007 model year vehicles are recomended to have a post-repair scan.</p><p>They also say the post-repair scan is to ensure that all DTCs are addressed and can assist in successful calibration.</p><p>Nissan/INFINITI finish by listing facts about diagnostics and DTCs, for example, “The proliferation of vehicle control systems has increased the potential number of DTCs beyond the point where dashboard indicators can illuminate for every DTC. The dashboard indicators are intended for driver notifications, NOT vehicle diagnostics.” </p><p>You can view Nissan position statements and INFINTI position statements on the RTS website.</p><p>For additional Nissan/INFINITI information, check out the following pages:<br>Nissan OEM Information<br>INFINITI OEM Information</p><p>Additional I-CAR Collision Repair News you may find helpful:<br>ADAS, Calibration, And Scanning Article Hotspot<br>Pre- and Post-Repair System Scanning Position Statements<br></p><h4>Related I-CAR Courses</h4><ul><li>Toyota/Lexus/Scion Position Statement: Pre- and Post-Repair System Scanning<span><small>July 28, 2016</small></span><div> As the industry continues to ask if pre- and post-repair system scanning is necessary, Toyota/Lexus/Scion provides their answer. </div></li><li>MIG Brazing What Is It, Why Should I Use It?<span><small>June 02, 2014</small></span><div> Why MIG Brazing?

Relies on pySerial to communicate with ELM scanners.</p><p>roflson/pyobd<br>Python-based interface that offers several improvements over the original pyOBD.</p><p>ScanTool.net open source software<br>ScanTool.net started as an open-source project several years ago, for use with the Windows OS. Apparently it’s quite usable on the Linux platform too – install it from the Ubuntu Software Center, or if you wish, by following this excellent Sam Hobbs tutorial.</p><p>Serialclient<br>A simple bit of software for communicating with a serial port from the command line.</p>top<br><h3>iOS Software</h3><p>The iPhone, iPad , and iPod continue to be very popular ways of interfacing to the ELM327.</p><p>A word of caution – the Bluetooth that Apple uses in iOS devices does not currently support the Serial Port Protocol (SPP). As such, iOS devices can not connect to ELM327 modules with Bluetooth – you must use WiFi with your device*.</p><p>AutoProPlus<br>AutoProPlus is a free app for monitoring your vehicle with an iPhone. A little difficult to figure out as the Owner’s Manual and web site are both very minimal. <a href='/sonivox-harmonica-vst-download.html'>Sonivox harmonica vst download</a>.</p><p>BT1<br>Another bit of software that works using Bluetooth, but only if you also purchase the GoPoint Technology BT1 interface module.</p><p>DashCommand<br>Palmer Performance are here with another app for ELM327s and compatibles. DashCommand is a reasonable price considering what you get. You can also purchase enhancements that allow more than just generic data for many vehicles.</p><p>Engine Link<br>This app continuously monitors several engine parameters, but it’s not clear how you can modify (or stop) them. It does allow you to define custom PIDs though, which might be handy (depending on just what you are using the scan tool for).</p><p>EOBD Facile<br>The basic version of this app is free, and works well. It provides some vehicle information, and will read trouble codes, but you can not clear them unless you buy the full package. Once you’ve got to that point, you will know how you like the software, and the decision should be easy. Well worth a try.</p><p>ezOBD<br>Up and Running have a free app that may be just what you’re looking for. The reviews aren’t in on it yet, but it is being updated regularly.</p><p>FORScan Lite<br>Lite version of the popular Windows software. Requires a WiFi ELM327 (or compatible) device.</p><p>iOBD2<br>This software offers free support for their iOBD2 hardware, but you must pay in order to connect to an ELM327 device.</p><p>NovaScan – The OBD Total Solution<br>ubiqCOM offers this software for the iPad or iPhone. Unfortunately, the free demo version will not connect to a vehicle, so you can not really try it before you buy it.</p><p>OBD Car Doctor<br>A great little bit of free software. Provides all the basics, and works quite well.</p><p>OBD Fusion<br>A full-featured interface from OCTech that sells for a reasonable price. Does just about everything that you would want and now even offers support for the Apple Watch.</p><p>* We are aware that older iOS devices have serial data available at the 30 pin connector, but do not know of any software that you could use to take advantage of it.</p>top<br><h3>Android Software</h3><p>There’s a large number of Android Apps for talking to the ELM327. We’ve had to pare it down to a few of the most popular:</p><p>Car Gauge Pro<br>OBD Scantech’s app provides all the basics, as well as enhanced diagnostic data for many vehicles. The price is quite reasonable too.</p><p>CarSys Scan<br>OBD High Tech offers a free app that provides all the basics. For use with Bluetooth scan tools.</p><p>DashCommand<br>Palmer Performance also supports the ELM327 (and compatibles) on Android. This app only allows 30 minutes of (limited) use before you have to make your decision whether to buy.</p><p>eCar PRO<br>This software reads your OBD information through Bluetooth, but does more than just read trouble codes. You can see and compare sensor data, set alarms, display times, and calculate torque and horsepower.</p><p>EOBD Facile<br>The basic version of this app is free, and works well. It provides some vehicle information, and will read trouble codes, but you can not clear them unless you buy the full package. Once you’ve got to that point, you will know how you like the software, can decide whether to purchase the ‘Premium Access’ package. Well worth a try.</p><p>ELM327 Terminal<br>Designed to send pre-defined AT and OBD commands for you. It’s a free app that may be right for you.</p><p>Elm Basic<br>This is terminal program for sending commands to an ELM327 interface and receiving replies.

If so, this handy app is certainly worth a look.</p><p>Kwik OBD Terminal<br>Another terminal program for sending commands to an ELM327 interface and receiving replies. Just what you may need if you want to stay in complete control.</p><p>Leaf Spy Pro<br>Owners of the Nissan Leaf will be interested in this Android app. There’s also a free version (Leaf Spy Lite) that will give battery info. The Leaf Spy Pro page on the Electric Vehicle Wiki is a must-visit too.</p><p>OBD Auto Doctor<br>This one is very similar to the iOS version, and it remains a free app too. A great little bit of software that provides all the basics and works well.</p><p>OBD Car Doctor<br>This one is very similar to the iOS version, and it remains a free app too. A great little bit of free software. Provides all the basics and works well.</p><p>OBD Trouble Codes Lite<br>Get trouble code descriptions on your phone or tablet. The free version of this app (ad sponsored) contains the generic trouble codes (from P0001 to P099F) in its database. The full (paid) version contains almost 20000 codes.</p><p>Piston (OBD2 &amp; ELM327)<br>Marcin Gierlicki’s ‘Piston’ seems to be well designed, and worked well in testing. A free offering that should be one of the first to try.</p><p>RaceChrono<br>A popular lap timer app that logs both gps information and OBD data. The free version is time-limited, so if you find it useful, you will want to upgrade to the pro version.</p><p>ScanMaster for ELM327<br>A great free app from WGSoft.de, makers of the other ScanMaster programs. Should be one of the first apps that you try. Has in-app purchases.</p><p>Scanclic<br>Most of the OBD software available is in English, but if you prefer Italian, one company (Informaticlaclic) offers Windows and Android software packages that may be of interest to you.</p><p>ScanMyOpel Lite<br>This app is only for Opel/Vauxhall diagnostics, but that is exactly what many users are looking for. Try this Lite (limited) version before you decide whether to buy the full one.</p><p>Torque Lite<br>Free version of the popular app offers a lot for no cost.</p><p>Torque Pro<br>Is the full version of the app, which offers more features, supports more vehicles, and does not have ads.</p><p>TouchScan<br>This modestly priced app is getting fairly good reviews. If you’re looking for an app with a gauge type interface, this one is worth considering.</p><p>Note that most Android software requires that you already be paired with a Bluetooth device. We are often asked about pairing codes and while we can never know exactly what code would apply to your interface, we can say that most use either 0000 or 1234.</p>top<br><h3>Nissan Scan Tool Software Downloads</h3><h3>Other Software</h3><p>Some items that don’t fit into the above categories:</p><p>Electric Vehicle Wiki<br>Interest in electric vehicles continues to grow.
