When your SD card won't work on Mac, the first thing to check is whether the card reader is working or not. It doesn't matter that you access the SD card by the built-in slot on your Mac or a third-party one. Simply follow these steps to check if the SD card reader is recognized or not.</p><h2>USB port types and names</h2><p>USB (Universal Serial Bus) is an industry standard for connecting computers and other devices. It's available with many types of ports, and each type has a unique shape. On Mac, USB is available with these ports, depending on your Mac model: </p><h3>USB-A</h3><img src='http://downloadbasket.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Presario_CQ58_Teaser_04-680x591.jpg' alt='Usb' title='Usb'><p>Type USB-A ports are commonly called USB, USB 2, or USB 3 ports, depending on the USB specification they support. They aren't reversible, so a USB-A connector plugs into the port only when oriented correctly.</p><h3>USB-C</h3><p>Type USB-C ports are available on Mac as standard USB-C ports, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports. They all look the same, and the connector plugs into the port in either orientation.</p><p><span>Learn more about identifying the ports on your Mac, as well as the adapters and cables you can use to connect older devices to type USB-C ports.</span></p><h2>USB specifications</h2><p>USB specifications are important primarily when you want the most speed and power for your USB device, or your device needs more power or is using too much power. Every USB port supports a particular USB specification, which determines the port's maximum&gt;USB specifications on MacData transferPower deliveryUSB 4Up to 10 GbpsUp to 15W at 5VUSB 3.1 Gen 2<br><span>Also known as USB 3.2 Gen 2</span><br>Up to 10 GbpsUp to 15W at 5VUSB 3.1 Gen 1<br><span>Also known as USB 3.2 Gen 1 or USB 3</span><br>Up to 5 GbpsUp to 900 mA at 5VUSB 2.0<br>Up to 480 MbpsUp to 500 mA at 5VUSB 1.1<br>Up to 12 MbpsUp to 500 mA at 5V</p><p><a href='https://ameblo.jp/tilastcipet1978/entry-12633017684.html'>https://ameblo.jp/tilastcipet1978/entry-12633017684.html</a>. Yet most recent phones do require these. In addition, if Google applications on older phones have actually been updated, this Google Setups app will be required to utilize them.It is very important right here to note that Google Play and also Google Play Services are two different entities.</p><p>To learn which specification is supported by a type USB-A or type USB-C port on your Mac model:</p><ul><li>Choose Apple menu  &gt; About This Mac, click Support, then click Specifications. </li><li>Check the System Information app for more details, including about USB devices connected to USB ports on your Mac. Select USB in the sidebar, then select a USB bus on the right.</li></ul><h2>Get the best performance from your USB devices</h2><p>USB specifications all work with each other, but speed and power are limited by the cable or device that uses the earliest specification. For example, if you connect a USB 3 device to USB 2 port, your device is limited to USB 2 speeds, and it can't draw more power from the port than can be delivered over USB 2. In other words, to get the best performance, make sure that the USB port on your Mac and the USB cable to your device meet or exceed the USB specification of the device itself.</p><p>If your Mac doesn't recognize a USB device after you plug it into your Mac:</p><ul><li>Check all connections: Unplug the device from your Mac, then plug it back in, and make sure that all cables and adapters are securely connected at both ends. Test with another cable or adapter, if available.</li><li>Plug the device directly into your Mac instead of a USB hub or other device, and if necessary test with a different USB port on your Mac or device.</li><li>Some devices need their own software, such as drivers or firmware. Others work without additional software. Check with the maker of your device, and install all available Apple software updates as well.</li><li>If your device came with an AC power adapter, use it. Some devices can be powered by the USB port on your Mac. Others need more power than your Mac can provide.</li><li>Restart your Mac.</li></ul><h2>Learn more</h2><ul><li>USB 3 devices can create wireless interference that affects Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices. Learn how to resolve Wi-Fi and Bluetooth issues caused by wireless interference.</li><li>Mac notebook computers with USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, or Thunderbolt / USB 4 can charge over that port using a compatible USB-C power adapter and cable.</li></ul><p><span>Summary:</span> SD card not working on your Mac?

Therefore, if you don't set the preference to show your SD card on the desktop, it won't appear on Mac. Easy to understand, huh? Let's see how to show SD card on the desktop?</p><ul><li>1. Go to Finder &gt; Preferences &gt; General, make sure the 'External disks' option is ticked. This will make the SD card show up on the Desktop.</li><li>2. Select the <span>Sidebar</span> tab on the top, make sure the <span>External disks</span> option under <span>Locations</span> is also ticked. </li></ul><h3>Option 2: Restart your Mac</h3><p>Whether the issue is related to networking, graphics, slow performance, faulty programs or macOS issue, a simple reboot can fix a computer issue 80-90% of the time. It also works when external drives are not recognized by macOS. </p><p>When your SD card is not reading on Mac, you can try to remove the SD card and then switch off the Mac. Leave it for a few minutes, turn it back on, and try again.</p><h3>Option 3: Check if SD card reader is not working</h3><p>To access an SD card, you usually need a card reader. When your SD card won't work on Mac, the first thing to check is whether the card reader is working or not. It doesn't matter that you access the SD card by the built-in slot on your Mac or a third-party one. Simply follow these steps to check if the SD card reader is recognized or not. </p><ul><li>1. Simply click Apple Menu &gt; About This Mac &gt; System Report.</li><li>2. Find <span>Card Reader</span> under the <span>Hardware</span> list.</li><li>3. If the card reader works, you can see its Vendor ID, Serial Number, and some other product information. When your SD card is inserted, it should also be listed at the right with specifications.</li></ul><p>If unfortunately, the card reader is not recognized, it might be an SD card hardware issue. For a broken slot built-in your MacBook, you need to send it to a local Apple store for repair service. Instead, for a malfunctioned external SD card reader, you can simply replace it with a new one.</p><p>• How to fix SD card reader not working on Mac?</p><h3>Option 4: Check for the connection issue</h3><p>If the card reader is working fine, then you should check the connections. First of all, make sure you insert your SD card properly. (The metal contacts must face down and point toward your Mac). Secondly, you can test your SD card on a different card reader. If you can access the SD card then, it should be the card reader that has a problem. </p><h3>Option 5: Check if SD card is locked</h3><h3 id='scr3310-usb-smart-card-reader-drivers-for-mac'>Scr3310 Usb Smart Card Reader Drivers For Mac</h3><p>Another case for SD card not working on Mac is that the SD card is write protected. When you try to write content to the locked SD card, you cannot modify the files on the locked SD card. To work on the SD card again, you need to safely eject the SD card and adjust the lock slider tab on the card to unlock the card. Then you can access the SD card after you reinsert it to the slot. </p><h3>Option 6: Insert your SD card in different devices</h3><p>Another very effective strategy that you can implement is to insert the SD card in different devices, such as phones, digital cameras, or other computers. For instance, you can remove the SD card from your Mac and insert it into your Android phone. If your SD card is still not detected or working on a phone, the card might be damaged or you need to try the following solutions.</p><h3>Option 7: Reset NVRAM/PRAM</h3><p>NVRAM/PRAM is a chip in Intel-based Macs used to remember the setting for your computer, including sound volume, display resolution, startup disk selection, time zone, peripheral devices and more. It's worth resetting whenever you find your computer's hardware acting in unexpected ways.</p><p>To reset NVRAM, you should shut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold <span>Option</span> + <span>Command</span> + <span>P</span> + <span>R</span>. Keep holding down those keys for about 20 seconds. Then release the keys and allow your Mac to continue starting normally.</p><h3>Option 8: Mount SD card in Disk Utility</h3><p>After resetting NVRAM/PRAM, your SD card is still not recognized on Mac. You should go to Disk Utility again and see whether the SD card is listed. If you can see your SD card in Disk Utility, but the SD card is greyed out, that means the SD card is not mounting. Simply select the Mount option to see if the SD card will be mounted in Finder and desktop.</p><h3>Option 9: Update the drivers on Mac</h3><p>If the issue still exists, you can check whether the drivers on your Mac is renewed. If your Mac drivers are outdated, your SD card or other external hard drives will not be recognized by your Mac. Here are steps to update drives on Mac:</p><p>1. If you have upgraded to macOS Mojave, you should choose <span>System Preferences</span> from the Apple menu, then click <span>Software Update</span> to check for updates. If any updates are available, click <span>Update Now</span> to install them.</p><div class='jpgqji'><iframe width='auto' height='auto' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/sG3c1f7hQdU' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>2. If you are using earlier macOS versions, just launch the Mac App Store, click the <span>Update</span> tab on the top and then choose the 'Update All'.</p><h3>Option 10: Repair SD card via First Aid</h3><p>Still, have no luck to get your Mac to read the SD card? The SD card may be corrupted and needs to be repaired. All portable hard drives have a limited life span, as wear and tear could bring bad sectors on the disk. Thankfully, macOS has a built-in repair tool - First Aid, which allows you to fix SD card errors on Mac.</p><ul><li>1. Go to Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Disk Utility.</li><li>2. Select the corrupted SD card and click 'First Aid' on the top.</li><li>3. Wait until the reparation process finished.</li></ul><p>Option 11: Format your SD card</p><p>If unfortunately, you receive the error message: 'Disk Utility can't repair this disk.
