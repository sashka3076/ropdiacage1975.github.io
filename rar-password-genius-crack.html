But this method<strong> only works with numeric passwords</strong> and it<strong> takes a very long time</strong>. Below is how it works: </p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Copy and paste the command line into Notepad. Then save the created notepad as bat. </p><p><em>@echo off<br> title WinRar Password Retriever<br> copy 'C:Program FilesWinRARUnrar.exe'<br> SET PASS=0<br> SET TMP=TempFold<br> MD %TMP%<br> :RAR<br> cls<br> echo.<br> SET/P 'NAME=File Name : '<br> IF '%NAME%'' goto ProblemDetected<br> goto GPATH<br> :ProblemDetected<br> echo You can't leave this blank.<br> pause<br> goto RAR<br> :GPATH<br> SET/P 'PATH=Enter Full Path (eg: C:UsersAdminDesktop) : '<br> IF '%PATH%'' goto PERROR<br> goto NEXT<br> :PERROR<br> echo You can't leave this blank.<br> pause<br> goto RAR<br> :NEXT<br> IF EXIST '%PATH%%NAME%' GOTO SP<br> goto PATH<br> :PATH<br> cls<br> echo File couldn't be found.

When you reopen the RAR file, you may found you will not be asked to provide a password. </p><h3> Method 5 - Break WinRAR Password with Common-used Passwords </h3><p> It is the simplest method, but the chance of success is relatively low.
