If you don't know how to download the library or if you are having a problem while downloading, you can look at <em>our download guide</em> a few lines above.</blockquote><h3><span>Method 1: Fixing the DLL Error by Copying the Waveshell.dll Library to the Windows System Directory</span><i>link</i></h3><ol><li>The file you downloaded is a compressed file with the '<strong>.zip</strong>' extension. In order to install it, first, double-click the '<strong>.zip</strong>' file and open the file. You will see the library named '<strong>Waveshell.dll</strong>' in the window that opens up. This is the library you need to install. Drag this library to the desktop with your mouse's left button. </li><li> Copy the '<strong>Waveshell.dll</strong>' library and paste it into the '<strong>C:WindowsSystem32</strong>' directory. </li><li> If your operating system has a <strong>64 Bit</strong> architecture, copy the '<strong>Waveshell.dll</strong>' library and paste it also into the '<strong>C:WindowssysWOW64</strong>' directory. <blockquote><strong>NOTE!</strong> On <strong>64 Bit</strong> systems, the dynamic link library must be in both the '<strong>sysWOW64</strong>' directory as well as the '<strong>System32</strong>' directory. In other words, you must copy the '<strong>Waveshell.dll</strong>' library into both directories.</blockquote></li><li> In order to complete this step, you must <u>run the Command Prompt as administrator</u>. In order to do this, all you have to do is follow the steps below. <blockquote><strong>NOTE!</strong> We ran the Command Prompt using <strong>Windows 10</strong>. If you are using <strong>Windows 8.1</strong>, <strong>Windows 8</strong>, <strong>Windows 7</strong>, <strong>Windows Vista</strong> or <strong>Windows XP</strong>, you can use the same method to run the Command Prompt as administrator.</blockquote><ol><li> Open the <strong>Start Menu</strong> and before clicking anywhere, type '<em>cmd</em>' on your keyboard. This process will enable you to run a search through the <strong>Start Menu</strong>. We also typed in '<em>cmd</em>' to bring up the Command Prompt. </li><li> Right-click the '<strong>Command Prompt</strong>' search result that comes up and click the <strong>Run as administrator</strong>' option. </li></ol></li><li> Paste the command below into the <strong>Command Line</strong> that will open up and hit <strong>Enter</strong>. This command will delete the damaged registry of the <strong>Waveshell.dll</strong> library <em>(It will not delete the file we pasted into the <strong>System32</strong> directory; it will delete the registry in <strong>Regedit</strong>. The file we pasted into the <strong>System32</strong> directory will not be damaged)</em>. <blockquote>%windir%System32regsvr32.exe /u Waveshell.dll</blockquote></li><li> If you are using a <strong>Windows</strong> version that has <strong>64 Bit</strong> architecture, after running the above command, you need to run the command below. With this command, we will clean the problematic <strong>Waveshell.dll</strong> registry <strong>for 64 Bit</strong><em>(The cleaning process only involves the registries in <strong>Regedit</strong>. In other words, the dynamic link library you pasted into the <strong>SysWoW64</strong> will not be damaged)</em>. <blockquote>%windir%SysWoW64regsvr32.exe /u Waveshell.dll</blockquote></li><li> We need to make a new registry for the dynamic link library in place of the one we deleted from the <strong>Windows Registry Editor</strong>. In order to do this process, copy the command below and after pasting it in the <strong>Command Line</strong>, press <strong>Enter</strong>. <blockquote>%windir%System32regsvr32.exe /i Waveshell.dll</blockquote></li><li> If the <strong>Windows version</strong> you use has <strong>64 Bit</strong> architecture, after running the command above, you must run the command below. With this command, you will create a clean registry for the problematic registry of the <strong>Waveshell.dll</strong> library that we deleted. <blockquote>%windir%SysWoW64regsvr32.exe /i Waveshell.dll</blockquote></li><li>If you did the processes in full, the installation should have finished successfully. If you received an error from the command line, you don't need to be anxious. Even if the Waveshell.dll library was installed successfully, you can still receive error messages like these due to some incompatibilities. In order to test whether your dll issue was fixed or not, try running the program giving the error message again. If the error is continuing, try <strong>the 2nd Method</strong> to fix this issue.</li></ol><h3><span>Method 2: Copying The Waveshell.dll Library Into The Program Installation Directory</span><i>link</i></h3><ol><li> First, you need to find the installation directory for the program you are receiving the '<em>Waveshell.dll not found</em>', '<em>Waveshell.dll is missing</em>' or other similar dll errors. In order to do this, <strong>right-click</strong> on the shortcut for the program and click the <strong>Properties</strong> option from the options that come up. </li><li> Open the program's installation directory by clicking on the <strong>Open File Location</strong> button in the <strong>Properties</strong> window that comes up. </li><li> Copy the <strong>Waveshell.dll</strong> library into the directory we opened. </li><li> The installation is complete. Run the program that is giving you the error. If the error is continuing, you may benefit from trying the <strong>3rd Method</strong> as an alternative.</li></ol><h3><span>Method 3: Doing a Clean Install of the program That Is Giving the Waveshell.dll Error</span><i>link</i></h3><ol><li> Press the '<strong>Windows</strong>' + '<strong>R</strong>' keys at the same time to open the <strong>Run</strong> tool. Paste the command below into the text field titled '<strong>Open</strong>' in the <strong>Run</strong> window that opens and press the <strong>Enter</strong> key on your keyboard. This command will open the '<strong>Programs and Features</strong>' tool. <blockquote>appwiz.cpl</blockquote></li><li> On the <strong>Programs and Features</strong> screen that will come up, you will see the list of programs on your computer. Find the program that gives you the dll error and with your mouse right-click it. The right-click menu will open. Click the '<strong>Uninstall</strong>' option in this menu to start the uninstall process. </li><li> You will see a '<em>Do you want to uninstall this program?</em>' confirmation window. Confirm the process and wait for the program to be completely uninstalled. The uninstall process can take some time. This time will change according to your computer's performance and the size of the program. After the program is uninstalled, restart your computer. </li><li>4. After restarting your computer, reinstall the program that was giving you the error.</li><li>This method may provide the solution to the dll error you're experiencing. If the dll error is continuing, the problem is most likely deriving from the <strong>Windows</strong> operating system. In order to fix <strong>dll errors deriving from the Windows operating system</strong>, complete <strong>the 4th Method</strong> and <strong>the 5th Method</strong>.</li></ol><h3><span>Method 4: Fixing the Waveshell.dll Error using the Windows System File Checker (sfc /scannow)</span><i>link</i></h3><ol><li> In order to complete this step, you must <u>run the Command Prompt as administrator</u>. In order to do this, all you have to do is follow the steps below. <blockquote><strong>NOTE!</strong> We ran the Command Prompt using <strong>Windows 10</strong>. If you are using <strong>Windows 8.1</strong>, <strong>Windows 8</strong>, <strong>Windows 7</strong>, <strong>Windows Vista</strong> or <strong>Windows XP</strong>, you can use the same method to run the Command Prompt as administrator.</blockquote><ol><li> Open the <strong>Start Menu</strong> and before clicking anywhere, type '<em>cmd</em>' on your keyboard.
