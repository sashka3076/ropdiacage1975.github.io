Please make sure it was installed correctly.<br>massages like this</p></div></li></ol>With hundreds of Waves Plugins to choose from..<br> Finding the absolute best Waves plugins can be quite a challenge.<br> Waves is one of the leading audio companies in the world right now and for good reason.<br> Almost all of their plugins are up to industry standards and sound amazing.<br> Not to mention, they‚Äôve actually teamed up with some of the best audio engineers in the world!<br> Even top level mixing and mastering engineers like Chris Lord Alge and Michael Brauer have given their expertise &amp; feedback to the Waves developers.<br> So it‚Äôs no wonder they are praised for some of best Waves plugins in the game.<br> In fact, they have over 180 incredible plugins that are used world wide!<br> For this reason, we had to make a top 15 best Waves plugins for the modern producer - allowing you to focus more on the music and less on the endless choices!<br><h2><strong>Waves Plugins #</strong><strong>1 - CLA Classic Compressors</strong></h2><br> This 3 compressor plugin bundle is an instant classic.<br> They‚Äôre modeled after the legendary LA-2A, LA-3A and the 11-76 - Compressors you‚Äôll find in almost every major professional studio as hardware units.<br> These compressors are arguably some of the most used tools by audio engineers on a daily basis. They‚Äôre truly incredible.<br> With each compressor acting differently than the other, you're sure to find a tool in this bundle that will help you in any situation that requires compression.<br> Here‚Äôs what each of them can do for your production:<br><ol><li>The CLA-76 is a really quick compressor that works superbly with fast, dynamic input signals such as drums and percussion. If you want to add punch to your productions, use this compressor!</li></ol><br><ol><li>The CLA-2A isn‚Äôt really used to control dynamics as you would with a regular compressor. This rather slow compressor is widely used mainly because of its character/tone. Try putting this compressor after a quick one (assuming you need dynamic control first) to enhance your tracks!</li></ol><br><ol><li>The CLA-3A is a compressor/limiter plugin based on a famous solid state unit from the 70‚Äôs known for its unique transparent compression curve. This compressor works the best with basses and guitars since it adds harmonic distortion to the input signal, something the original hardware unit was known for! Old engineers were limited on how many of these compressors they could use, but with this amazing plugin emulation, you can fire up as many as your computer can handle!</li></ol><br> They have all stood the test of time for a reason, making them easily some of the best Waves plugins.<br><h2><strong>Waves Plugins #</strong><strong>2 - Brauer Motion</strong></h2><br> You might have heard Michael Brauer‚Äôs name before. But if you haven‚Äôt, this guy is an absolute legend in the audio engineering world.<br> He's won several Grammys for ‚ÄúBest Vocal Pop Album‚Äù with John Mayer‚Äôs ‚ÄúContinuum‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Rock Album‚Äù with Coldplay‚Äôs ‚ÄúViva La Vida‚Äù<br> So the fact that he joined forces with Waves to create this amazing spatial plugin is a HUGE deal.<br> This plugin helps add to your otherwise static mixdowns by creating an even greater sense of depth through the stereo field.<br> A great static mixdown is one of the first steps to a great sounding mix, but that can be pretty boring in electronic music! (And just about every other genre too)<br> If you listen carefully to any of your favorite tracks, some of its elements are most likely moving left and right, either subtly or drastically!<br> And this plugin can help you create the same effect.<br> The Brauer Motion plug-in isn‚Äôt only useful in music production though. If you are making cinematic tracks or film scores, this plugin can help you manipulate and make the listener immerse into the visual world!<br> If you want to see more of why this is one of the best Waves plugins, check out this incredible demo video Michael Brauer made with Waves over <u>here</u>.<br><h2><strong>Waves Plugins #3 - F6 Floating Band Dynamic EQ</strong></h2><br> First of all, we need to emphasize that this plugin is a dynamic EQ.<br> What does that mean?<h3 id='waves-j37-free-download'>Waves J37 Free Download</h3><br> Whenever you use any other regular EQ - for example, your DAW‚Äôs stock EQ - you are committing your track(s) to specific EQ parameters that are going to stay constant during your whole song.<br> What a dynamic EQ does is allow you to set thresholds like the ones found in most compressors, so the EQ only engages when the signal goes above the threshold.<br> This is an incredibly handy tool for multiple scenarios.<br> Imagine you have a rolling bass or synth line with the filter opening up at certain times during your song.<br> When the filter opens, it becomes a little bit harsh. With a regular EQ you can control those harsh frequencies, but when the filter closes once again, it‚Äôs taking out frequencies that otherwise might be useful.<br> This is where a dynamic EQ comes in.<br> If you are wondering if this works the opposite way too, boosting instead of cutting after going below the threshold, you're right.<br> A dynamic EQ functions both ways, making it easily one of the best Waves plugins if you‚Äôre looking for a better mix!<br><h2><strong>Waves Plugins #4 - Waves Center</strong></h2><br> If you've never heard about this plugin, it‚Äôs one of the most useful tools out there that you've been missing out on!<br> Waves Center is basically a plugin that allows you to separate the center content from your signal on the sides (L/R).<br> If you're an Ableton user, this is similar to the Utility plugin, but on steroids!<br> It comes with 3 knobs that allow you to push the low and high frequency content either to the center or the sides.<br> The punch knob has the same functionality, but with the transients of your input signal!<br> If this has been too confusing, let us explain the power of this plugin with an example.<br> Imagine you have an acapella you want to use for your remix, but it has unwanted sounds from the instrumental in the sides, and you just can‚Äôt EQ it out.<br> Simply use this plugin and drag the ‚ÄúSides‚Äù fader until you achieve the desired result!<br> For that reason, this plugin is almost like magic!<br><h2><strong>Waves Plugins #</strong><strong>5 - Kramer Tape</strong></h2><br> This amazing plugin is modeled after a rare vintage tape machine.<br> It‚Äôs very likely that you have heard another producer say before how awesome tape or vinyl sound is.<br> This is THE tape plugin you are looking for.<br> It‚Äôs subtle, but once you put it in your track you can definitely hear a tonal change without even moving any parameter or choosing a preset.<br> This plugin has so many uses we could write an entire article about it!<br> But instead, you can watch this really cool video made by <u>True Sound Studios</u> showcasing many of its uses <u>here</u>.<br> What you‚Äôll realize afterwards is that this is by far one of the coolest plugins Waves has to offer.<br><h2><strong>Waves Plugins #</strong><strong>6 - API Collection</strong></h2><br> The API EQ‚Äôs and compressor are another instant classic for many professional studios.<br> Waves actually teamed up with API to deliver the sound of the original hardware, making them some of the best Wave plugins for your mix.<br> Not only that, but it‚Äôs so user friendly that you don‚Äôt even have to read the manual if you have some experience with EQ‚Äôs and compressors.<br> You can just dive right in and use the same EQ and compressor that some of the biggest artists in the world have!<br> Believe it or not, the hardware versions of API gear were used in many of Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin‚Äôs recordings.<br> And if that doesn‚Äôt really convince you about their awesomeness, you can watch Virtual Riot in<u>this</u> old recorded stream from 2014 using the API-2500 multiple times.<br><h2><strong>Waves Plugin #</strong><strong>7 - Vitamin Sonic Enhancer</strong></h2><br> The Vitamin Sonic Enhancer is a multi-band harmonic enhancer plugin that has a little bit of a learning curve, but‚Ä¶<br> It can make any track sound incredibly powerful if used correctly.<br> The controls are rather intuitive.<br> You can determine the crossover frequency points between the five different bands and get noticeable results instantly. You can also control the mix of the direct signal with its enhanced version with the Direct Fader.<br> The sonic effect of this plugin is widely determined by the type of input signal - vocals, guitars, synths, drums, or even an entire mix -<br> For that reason, we really encourage you to spend some time with it to understand it, because this plugin can even save your song when it‚Äôs missing that ‚Äúextra something‚Äù.<br> The results are comparable to what you would get from a parallel chain of EQ, compression, and saturation, but all in one single plugin.<br> In this<u>5 minute tutorial</u> at the<u>Pro Tools Expert website</u>, they show you how to sweeten tracks using the Waves Vitamin Sonic Enhancer plugin.<br><h2><strong>Waves Plugins #</strong><strong>8 - PuigTec EQ‚Äôs</strong></h2><br> We're going to be completely honest here: these EQ‚Äôs are some of our secret weapons..<br> They‚Äôre definitely not unknown, but we believe that many people overlook them!<br><h3 id='waves-j37-vst-download-mediafire'>Waves J37 Vst Download Mediafire</h3> The PuigTec EQ‚Äôs were developed by Jack Joseph Puig - the engineer behind many hits from U2, Lady Gaga, and The Rolling Stones.<br> What makes the PuigTec EQ‚Äôs unique is that they can boost and cut the same frequency at the same time, creating a really unique resonant shelving sound.<br> It‚Äôs a subtle sound which is hard to describe with words, so you might want to check it out yourself.<br> Once you hear it, it‚Äôll be quite obvious why this is one of the best Waves plugins out there.<br><h2><strong>Waves Plugins #9 - Reel ADT</strong></h2><br> The Abbey Road Studios developed a famous technique called ‚ÄúArtificial Double Tracking‚Äù in the mid 60‚Äôs.<br> The ‚ÄúADT‚Äù quickly became the sound of the whole era, made popular by The Beatles.<br> Waves did an excellent job of packing all of this plus extra features into one single plugin..<br> The Reel ADT!<br> And now, you can have this iconic sound downloaded as a single plugin right on your computer.<br> If you want to see this thing in action, check out<u>Joel Cameron</u> on YouTube experimenting with the ‚ÄúADT‚Äù technique over<u>here</u>.<br> Or, you can watch this incredible<u>in-depth tutorial</u> by Waves where they go into all the cool features this plugin has to offer.<br><h2><strong>Waves Plugins #</strong><strong>10 - Vocal Rider</strong></h2><br> If you are doing a lot of vocal production, you need this plugin.
